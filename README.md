## Hey, I'm abignağŸ‘‹
I'm a passionate and enthusiastic computer science student, who would love to make things you see in science fiction, a reality. Not all science fiction should be reality, just the few special ones like just a rather very intelligent system.

ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on several projects but would love to work on more!

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning full stack

ğŸ’¬ Ask me about anything! I'm always open to engage especially if you see the reference.
